      <h1> Semester 1 Project</h1>
      
      <p>In my first semester at Hocking College I learned the following three things from HTML/CSS I and JavaSCript I </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li> Number 1 </li>
        <li> Number 2 </li>
        <li> Number 3 </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p> I also think that w3schools is a great resource to continue to learn more about web development</p>
      
      <p> The link to the web app we created from <a href = "https://academy.hubspot.com">HubSpot Academy</a> is <a href = "https://serene-plateau-70397.herokuapp.com/">Web App</p>
